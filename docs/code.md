# Code

## Repository

The [cffdrs-ng GitHub repository](https://github.com/nrcan-cfs-fire/cffdrs-ng) contains the up-to-date code for the CFFDRS2025 modules in three programming languages: R, Python, and C. All three languages contain the same equations and perform the same tasks, the choice is yours depending on your system requirements.

## Fire Weather Index 2025
The [Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI)](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/background/summary/fwi) is a major subsystem of the CFFDRS. FWI2025 is the next generation FWI system corresponding to the CFFDRS2025. The following describes the files, data inputs, parameters, and outputs in a general way for all three languages, noting the variations for specific languages.

### Scripts
Each programming language has three scripts that are required to generate FWI2025 outputs:

1. "NG_FWI" holds the functions and equations for generating FWI2025 outputs.

    R: **NG_FWI.r**  
    Python: **NG_FWI.py**  
    C: **NG_FWI.c**

2. "util" includes basic functions that are not part of FWI2025 equations, but generate intermediate information for the calculation of the FWI2025 components (e.g. time of sunrise and sunset, number of sunlight hours).

    R: **util.r**  
    Python: **util.py**  
    C: **util.c**, **util.h**

3. "daily_summaries" includes the process to generate the daily summary output.

    R: **daily_summaries.r**  
    Python: **daily_summaries.py**  
    C: (*in development*)

### Packages
The FWI2025 scripts require different sets of language-specific libraries or packages.  These must be installed prior to running "NG_FWI".

R: `lubridate`, `data.table`  
Python: `datetime`, `logging`, `math`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `os.path`, `sys`  
C: `stdlib.h`, `stdbool.h`, `string.h`

### Get Started
The [cffdrs-ng GitHub repository](https://github.com/nrcan-cfs-fire/cffdrs-ng/tree/main) also includes a tutorial script and test data. See the
<a href="../tutorials/#hourly-fwi" target="_self">Tutorials#Hourly FWI</a>
for a step-by-step workflow with hourly data. The documentation below goes into details about specific functions and data requirements.

### Format
FWI2025 code is written for and tested using input data in the form of a table/array, commonly imported as comma-separated value (.csv) files. Outputs are then also of the same table/array form.  Users can configure the input and output file types to fit their individual data streams.

### Documentation
#### Hourly Fire Weather Index
The `hFWI()` function in the "NG_FWI" file is built to generate FWI System outputs one station at a time. The R and Python versions can also output multiple stations with a properly formatted input. The C version can only handle inputs of a single year for a given station.

##### Input Data
The Fire Weather Index System was originally designed to be calculated using data recorded at local *weather stations*.  As a result, descriptions below reference weather station data as input.  In reality, any collected or calculated weather data (e.g. gridded data, forecast data, etc.) that includes the standard variables required as input to the FWI System can be used. See the [Weather Guide](https://ostrnrcan-dostrncan.canada.ca/handle/1845/219568) for a description of weather data input standards for the FWI System.

The rows of the dataframe should correspond to consecutive hourly data. The columns and data types of the input dataframe are as follows:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Weather station identifier, a unique number for the station, text or number |
| `lat` | Latitude of weather station, decimal degrees (°) (double precision) |
| `long` | Longitude of weather station, decimal degrees (°) (double precision) |
| `yr` | Year of weather station reading, number YYYY |
| `mon` | Month of weather station reading, number M or MM (must be consistent throughout the dataset) |
| `day` | Day of weather station reading, number DD or D (must be consistent throughout the dataset) |
| `hr` | Hour of weather station reading, number in military time (0-23) |
| `temp` | Temperature in degrees Celsius (°C), number |
| `rh` | Relative humidity in percent (%), number (0-100) |
| `ws` | Wind speed in kilometres per hour (km/hr), number |
| `prec` | Precipitation (rain) measured in millimetres (mm), number |
| `solrad` | Solar Radiation measured in kilowatts per square metre (kW/m^2) for grassland codes, number.  OPTIONAL input, FWI2025 will generate based on default method. ([CFFDRS2025 Solar Radiation Input (Draft)](../documents/CFFDRS2025_Draft-Solar-Radiation-as-Input.pdf)📥) |
| `percent_cured` | Percent Cured of grasses in open grassland, measured in percent for grassland codes, number (0-100). OPTIONAL input, FWI2025 will generate based on default method |

The column headers can be lower case or upper case, the output format is set to upper case.

In addition to the weather variables, the function to generate hourly FWI2025 outputs requires the timezone where the weather station is located and the start-up value for the moisture codes (e.g. FFMC of 85, DMC of 6 and DC of 15). See the next section below to see where it is specified.

##### Input Data
The only input to `generate_daily_summaries()` is the output from `hFWI()`.

##### Function Parameters
R:  

```r
generate_daily_summaries <- function(hourly_data) {}
```

Python: 

```python
def generate_daily_summaries(hourly_data):

C: 
```c
hourly_data = the output dataframe generated by NG_FWI
```

| `duration` | Number of hours (hr), number format.  Can also be called duration of a burning window, number of hours in the day where one could expect an active fire (where a modified ISI is equal or greater than five).  If the ISI did not reach 5 or greater, the duration is zero |
| `wind_speed_smoothed` | Wind Speed in kilometres per hour (km/hr), double precision. Hourly wind speed recorded based on a 10 min average can be noisy hour-to-hour, this makes it difficult to estimate the duration of a burning window.
