Jonathan Boucher is a Wildland Fire Research Scientist with the Canadian Forest Service based out of the Laurentian Forestry Centre in Quebec city, Quebec. Jonathan develops scientific knowledge to support wildfire management and risk management activities. His research interests include fire behavior, fire risk, fuel attributes modelling, mitigation actions at the wildland urban interface, and suppression effectiveness. At the Canadian scale, he is a member of the scientific committee and operational committee of the Forest Mapping Program for Wildland Fire Resilience, and a member of the steering committee of the National Wildland Fire Risk Assessment Framework for Canada. In the fire danger group, he leads the fuels component of the next generation of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System. He also leads the Firehawk Project, a web platform that is a rapid risk assessor for wildfires in Canada. Some of the other projects he led or participated in are the development of FireLossRate, a framework and R package designed to estimate the proportion of lost structures associated with a wildfire event, wildland fire risk analysis for a military base, using optimization tools to identify optimal locations for the implementation of fuel treatment measures, and the Reference guide to the drop effectiveness of skimmer and rotary wing airtankers, among many others.
 
Jonathan has done his undergraduate studies in forest management and environments (Laval University), his Master’s degree in renewable resources on the impacts of post-fire salvage logging on beetles associated with wildfires in the boreal forest (UQAC), and his PhD in forestry science on characterizing fire severity as a management tool for post-fire management in the boreal forest (Laval University). He then worked from 2015 to 2019 at SOPFEU where he gained valuable knowledge on wildfire management and operations, before obtaining his current position at the CFS in 2019.
