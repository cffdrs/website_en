Kevin is a new Fire Analyst Programmer with the Canadian Forest Service based out of the Great Lakes Forestry Centre in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. He is working on various aspects of the Next Generation Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (NG-CFFDRS) rollout. He is focused on analysis of fire danger outputs, code documentation, and the development of this website.

Kevin's academic background is in math and physics, which has allowed him to follow his curiosity into many different research fields. He has experience from his undergraduate degree working in a quantum computing physics lab, an icebreaker ship engineering team, and a glaciology research group. He is excited to learn more about forest fires and environmental science while helping improve the tools for wildland fire managers.
