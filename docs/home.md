## About

The [Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (CFFDRS)](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/our-natural-resources/forests/wildland-fires-insects-disturbances/canadian-forest-fire-danger-rating-system/14470) is the principal source of fire information for all [wildland fire management agencies](https://ciffc.ca/mobilization-stats/member-agencies) across Canada. It has widespread use as a regional and fireline safety and awareness tool. The CFFDRS is undergoing extensive revisions under the name [Next Generation CFFDRS (NG-CFFDRS)](https://ostrnrcan-dostrncan.canada.ca/handle/1845/245411), with rollout to practitioners occurring during 2024, 2025, and beyond. The primary goal is update the System to allow for the use of modern technology and data sources while maintaining its original simplicity and effectiveness.

This website is intended to:

- inform users about the ongoing changes to the CFFDRS
- centralize access to the code and documentation
- host tutorials for new users in multiple programming languages
