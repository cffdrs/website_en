## About

The [Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (CFFDRS)](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/our-natural-resources/forests/wildland-fires-insects-disturbances/canadian-forest-fire-danger-rating-system/14470) is the principal source of fire information for all [wildland fire management agencies](https://ciffc.ca/mobilization-stats/member-agencies) across Canada. It has widespread use as a regional and fireline safety and awareness tool. The CFFDRS is undergoing extensive revisions under the name [Next Generation CFFDRS (NG-CFFDRS)](https://ostrnrcan-dostrncan.canada.ca/handle/1845/245411), with rollout to practitioners occurring during 2024, 2025, and beyond. The primary goal is to meet the evolving needs of advanced users while maintaining it's original simplicity and effectiveness.

This website is intended to:

- inform users about the ongoing changes to the CFFDRS
- centralize access to the code and documentation
- host tutorials for new users

For those unfamiliar with the CFFDRS, or for official information regarding wildfires in Canada, read more on official Government of Canada pages under

The previous CFFDRS1992 code can be found on the [CFFDRS GitHub](https://github.com/cffdrs), while the R documentation can be found on the [CFFDRS CRAN page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cffdrs/).
