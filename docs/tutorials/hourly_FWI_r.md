If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, there are many options for you to retrieve the code and data files:

1. *Download each file* to your computer individually. On the file's GitHub page (e.g. [**PRF2007_hourly_wx.csv**](https://github.com/nrcan-cfs-fire/cffdrs-ng/blob/main/data/PRF2007_hourly_wx.csv)), find the "More file actions" button at the top-right side of the website (denoted "..."), and select "Download". This will begin downloading based on your browser settings. Repeat this for every file.
2. *Download the whole repository* to your computer. See the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/downloading-files-from-github) for more information.
3. *Clone* the whole repository to your computer with Git. See the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/downloading-files-from-github) for more information.
4. *Fork* the repository to create a new repository on GitHub. See the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/downloading-files-from-github) for more information.

Besides the files, ensure you have the required R packages, which are listed at <a href="../../code/FWI2025_R#packages" target="_self">FWI2025_R#packages</a>.

## Data
**PRF2007_hourly_wx.csv** contains hourly weather recorded from a Petawawa Research Forest (PRF) weather station during the 2007 field season. The data has no gaps and is sorted sequentially by time, which is a requirement for FWI2025 input data. If you would like guidance on how to fill in missing weather data for your situation, check the [CFFDRS Weather Guide](https://ostrnrcan-dostrncan.canada.ca/handle/1845/219568) or [reach out to us](../../contact)! The column headers are those required for hourly FWI calculations, details of which can be found at <a href="../../code/FWI2025_R#input-data" target="_self">FWI2025_R#input-data</a>. Grassland curing (`percent_cured`) and solar radiation (`solrad`) are not included, but these are optional inputs and they will be automatically calculated if not provided.

## Steps
Open the **tutorial_hourly_FWI.r** code file. You can either follow the code and comments in the file or continue on this page (both include the same code and content).

### Load libraries
Run `install.packages()` to install any you are missing
```r
library(lubridate)
library(data.table)
```

### Load functions and data
Check your current working directory
```r
getwd()
```
If the working directory is different from where you saved the FWI2025 scripts, change the working directory with `setwd()` to that folder.  

Load the files containing the functions and variables to calculate FWI2025.
```r
source("NG_FWI.r")
source("util.r")
source("daily_summaries.r")
```

Load the input weather station data file. Specify the file path if **PRF2007_hourly_wx.csv** is not in the working directory
```r
data <- read.csv("PRF2007_hourly_wx.csv")
```

Print the column names, data should contain 12 columns
```r
> names(data)
 [1] "id"       "lat"      "long"     "timezone" "yr"       "mon"
 [7] "day"      "hr"       "temp"     "rh"       "ws"       "prec"
```

Previously, the timezone (UTC offset) was a function parameter and calculated from latitude and longitude. Now it is a data frame column and provided. See the <a href="#appendix-timezones" target="_self">appendix of this tutorial</a> for extra information on how to calculate the timezone, along with the extra information required about the dataset.

### Run FWI2025
`hFWI()` is the function that calculates hourly FWI codes in FWI2025. Details about it can be found at <a href="../../code/FWI2025_R/#hourly-fwi" target="_self">FWI2025 - R#hourly-fwi</a>. It can handle multiple stations and years/fire seasons (not shown in this tutorial). Default FWI start-up code values are: ffmc_old = 85, dmc_old = 6, dc_old = 15.
```r
data_fwi <- hFWI(data)
```

Output is a data.frame (matching input class), with FWI calculations appended after the input columns. Save the output as a .csv file (overrides any preexisting file).
```r
write.csv(data_fwi, "PRF2007_hourly_FWI.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

Print the last two rows of the standard moisture codes and fire behaviour indices.
```r
> standard_components <- c("ffmc", "dmc", "dc", "isi", "bui", "fwi")
> tail(data_fwi[standard_components], 2)
        ffmc    dmc       dc    isi    bui    fwi
2622 80.2669 3.0924 219.5169 1.6423 5.9745 0.7650
2623 82.1759 3.3503 220.0533 2.1462 6.4550 1.2023
```

Print a simple summary of the standard FWI components.
```r
> summary(data_fwi[standard_components])
      ffmc            dmc               dc              isi
 Min.   : 0.00   Min.   : 0.000   Min.   : 15.41   Min.   : 0.0000

 3rd Qu.:34.605   3rd Qu.: 5.930
 Max.   :66.148   Max.   :25.135
```

### Calculate daily summaries
Calculate outputs like peak burn time and number of hours of spread potential. Details about the daily summaries function can be found at 
<a href="../../code/FWI2025_R/#daily-summaries" target="_self">FWI2025 - R#daily-summaries</a>.
```r
report <- generate_daily_summaries(data_fwi)
```

Print a simple summary of the daily report.

```r
> daily_components <- c("peak_hr", "duration", "isi_smooth", "dsr")
> summary(report[daily_components])
    peak_hr         duration        isi_smooth          dsr
 Min.   :13.00   Min.   : 0.000   Min.   : 0.000   Min.   :0.0000
 1st Qu.:17.00   1st Qu.: 0.000   1st Qu.: 1.234   1st Qu.:0.0338
 Median :17.00   Median : 0.000   Median : 4.032   Median :0.9913
 Mean   :17.29   Mean   : 2.697   Mean   : 4.324   Mean   :1.5533
 3rd Qu.:18.00   3rd Qu.: 5.000   3rd Qu.: 6.495   3rd Qu.:2.5940
 Max.   :23.00   Max.   :14.000   Max.   :15.771   Max.   :6.9486
```

From here, the outputs can be converted to any datatype for further analysis or plotted for visualization.

## Appendix: Timezones
This section will cover how to calculate a timezone based on a location (latitude and longitude) and date. Note that this is not necessarily a substitute for actual information about the time used in a dataset. The [CFFDRS Weather Guide](https://ostrnrcan-dostrncan.canada.ca/handle/1845/219568) specifies to collect data by local standard time, which is different in many places due to the shift to daylight time in summer months (daylight savings).

The 'lutz' library has functions to get the timezone of the weather station based on latitude and longitude.
```r
library(lutz)
```

First, make a dataframe of stations with unique ID, latitude, and longitude.

```r
stations <- unique(data[c("id", "lat", "long")])
```

Print the unique station IDs and coordinates. For this dataset the only station is at Petawawa Research Forest (PRF).
```r
> stations
   id    lat    long
1 PRF 45.996 -77.427
```

Find the timezone based on latitude and longitude, this can take some time. You may need to download the package 'sf' for method = "accurate".
```r
tz_loc <- tz_lookup_coords(stations$lat, stations$long, method = "accurate")
```

Print the timezone location. PRF is equivalent to "America/Toronto".
```r
> tz_loc
[1] "America/Toronto"
```

The UTC offset can then be determined from the timezone location.
```r
utc <- tz_offset("2007-05-10", tz_loc)[[5]]
```

Print the UTC offset.
```r
> utc
[1] -4
```

Since May 10, 2007 is during daylight savings the UTC offset calculated above corresponds to Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), UTC-4. This matches the timezone column provided since this data was collected using EDT. For Eastern Standard Time (EST), the UTC offset would be UTC-5.
