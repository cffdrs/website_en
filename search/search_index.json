Step 1: Open the data file: wx_prf.csv About the file: This file contains hourly weather recorded from weather station at the Petawawa Research Forest, during a field season in 2007. The data is sorted into ascending order and has not gaps. The column headers are formatted with the expected inputs, details on the input requirements can be found in Code#Documentation . Notice there is no input for solar radiation ( sol_rad ) or curing faction ( percent_cure ), these are optional inputs and if they are not in the input file, they will be automatically estimated.
