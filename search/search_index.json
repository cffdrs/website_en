Packages The FWI2025 R scripts require the following packages which must be installed prior to running NG_FWI.r . lubridate data.table Get Started The GitHub repository also includes a tutorial script and test data. See the Tutorials#Hourly FWI for a step-by-step workflow with hourly data. The documentation below goes into details about specific functions and data requirements. Data Format FWI2025 code is written for and tested using input data in the form of a table/array, commonly imported as comma-separated value (.csv) files. Each row then corresponds with a single timestep (i.e. hour), in sequential order. Outputs are then also of the same table/array form, with additional columns. In R, we use the data.table package and its data.table class to perform calculations. We accept input data in either data.table or the native data.frame class. The output will have the same class as the input. Users can configure the input file type before and output file type after calculation to fit individual data streams. Hourly FWI The hFWI() function (case sensitive) in the NG_FWI.r file calculates hourly FWI moisture codes and fire behaviour indices. It can handle multiple stations (locations) and multiple years of hourly input data all at once, or just a single hour. Input Data The FWI system was originally designed to be calculated using data recorded at local weather stations, but any collected or calculated data (e.g. gridded data, forecast data, etc.) that includes the required weather variables can be used. See the CFFDRS Weather Guide for a description of weather data standards for the FWI System. The table below describes the columns and data types for the input data.table or data.frame. Columns are required unless otherwise specified, in which case they will be set or calculated. The column names can be lower-case or upper-case, output columns are lower-case. Column Description Units Class id Unique identifier for weather station or location character lat Latitude DD numeric long Longitude DD numeric timezone UTC offset (can be specified in hFWI() parameter instead, see below ) numeric yr Year of data point integer mon Month of the year (1-12) integer day Day of the month (1-31) integer hr Hour of the day (0-23) integer temp Air temperature \u00b0C numeric rh Relative humidity (0-100) % numeric ws 10 m open wind speed km/hr numeric prec Hourly precipitation mm numeric grass_fuel_load Density of grassland fuels (default 0.35) kg/m^2 numeric percent_cured Fraction of grassland fuels that is cured (0-100, default based on annual variation in the Boreal Plains region) % numeric solrad Solar radiation \ud83d\udce5 (optional) kW/m^2 numeric In addition to the weather variables, you can specify start-up values for moisture codes and other parameters in hFWI() . Parameters The only required parameter for hFWI() is the input data.table or data.frame, although many start-up values can be altered from default if desired. If you are performing a \"live\" run which is a continuation from previous FWI outputs with new data, the prior outputs need to be specified. hFWI(df_wx, timezone = NA, ffmc_old = 85, mcffmc_old = NA, dmc_old = 6, dc_old = 15, mcgfmc_matted_old = 16.31, mcgfmc_standing_old = 16.31, prec_cumulative = 0.0, canopy_drying = 0.0, silent = FALSE, round_out = 4) Parameter Description df_wx data.table or data.frame with hourly weather stream (see Input Data section above) timezone UTC offset (default NA ). NA is for using a provided column in df_wx . Specifying a number will create/overwrite df_wx column. ffmc_old Previous value for FFMC (default 85). Set to NA if mcffmc_old is specified instead mcffmc_old Previous value for mcffmc (default NA ) dmc_old Previous value for DMC (default 6) dc_old Previous value for DC (default 15) mcgfmc_matted_old Previous value for mcgfmc_matted (default 16.31) mcgfmc_standing_old Previous value for mcgfmc_standing (default 16.31) prec_cumulative Cumulative precipitation this rainfall (default 0) canopy_drying Consecutive hours of no rain (default 0). 5 hours or more set to 0 silent Suppress informative print statements (default FALSE) round_out Decimal places to truncate output values to (default 4). Set to NA for no rounding Output The result of hFWI() is a copy of the input data.table or data.frame (of the same class), with output columns added, described below. This means all columns from the input, even ones that are unused, are still preserved in the output. Column Description grass_fuel_load Density of grassland fuels (if not provided) percent_cured Fraction of cured grassland fuels (if not provided) solrad Solar radiation (if not provided) sunrise Hour of sunrise sunset Hour of sunset sunlight_hours Number of hours between sunrise and sunset mcffmc Fine fuel moisture content ffmc Fine Fuel Moisture Code dmc Duff Moisture Code dc Drought Code isi Initial Spread Index bui Buildup Index fwi Fire Weather Index dsr Daily Severity Rating mcgfmc_matted Matted grassland fuel moisture content mcgfmc_standing Standing grassland fuel moisture content gfmc Grassland Fuel Moisture Code gsi Grassland Spread Index gfwi Grassland Fire Weather Index prec_cumulative Cumulative precipitation this rainfall canopy_drying Consecutive hours of no rain. 5 hours or more set to 0 Daily Summaries Hourly FWI components can be summarized in a variety of ways depending on usage and requirements. One way is to create a daily report, the method of which can be found in the daily_summaries.r script. generate_daily_summaries() boils down the hourly data into daily metrics, which means every row in the output now represents a day. To align more accurately with the typical daily fire behaviour cycle, the \"reset hour\" for a day can be redefined away from midnight (see reset_hr parameter below). By default, we use 05:00 (12 hours opposite 17:00), which means the 24 hours summarized are between 05:00 of the listed day and 04:00 of the next day (instead of 00:00 to 23:00). The first or last days are left out if they are represented by 12 or fewer hours of data. Parameters generate_daily_summaries(hourly_FWI, reset_hr = 5, silent = FALSE, round_out = 4) Parameter Description hourly_FWI data.table or data.frame produced by hFWI() (see Hourly FWI section above) reset_hr The boundary between days, instead of midnight (default 5) silent Suppress informative print statements (default FALSE) round_out Decimal places to truncate output values to (default 4). Set to NA for no rounding Output Parameter Description id Unique identifier for weather station or location yr Year mon Month of year day Day of month sunrise Hour of sunrise sunset Hour of sunset peak_hr Expected hour of daily maximum fire behaviour.

Packages The FWI2025 Python scripts require the following packages which must be installed prior to running NG_FWI.py . datetime (built-in) logging (built-in) argparse (built-in) math (built-in) numpy pandas Get Started The GitHub repository also includes a tutorial script and test data. See the Tutorials#Hourly FWI for a step-by-step workflow with hourly data. The documentation below goes into details about specific functions and data requirements. Data Format FWI2025 code is written for and tested using input data in the form of a table/array, commonly imported as comma-separated value (.csv) files. Each row then corresponds with a single timestep (i.e. hour), in sequential order. Outputs are then also of the same table/array form, with additional columns. In Python, we use the pandas package and its DataFrame data type to perform calculations. Users can configure the input file type before and output file type after calculation to fit individual data streams. Hourly FWI The hFWI() function (case sensitive) in the NG_FWI.py file calculates hourly FWI moisture codes and fire behaviour indices. It can handle multiple stations (locations) and multiple years of hourly input data all at once, or just a single hour.

Appendix: Timezones This section will cover how to calculate a timezone based on a location (latitude and longitude) and date. Note that this is not necessarily a substitute for actual information about the time used in a dataset. The CFFDRS Weather Guide specifies to collect data by local standard time, which is different in many places due to the shift to daylight time in summer months (daylight savings). The 'lutz' library has functions to get the timezone of the weather station based on latitude and longitude. library(lutz) First, make a dataframe of stations with unique ID, latitude, and longitude. stations <- unique(data[c(\"id\", \"lat\", \"long\")]) Print the unique station IDs and coordinates. For this dataset the only station is at Petawawa Research Forest (PRF). > stations id lat long 1 PRF 45.996 -77.427 Find the timezone based on latitude and longitude, this can take some time. You may need to download the package 'sf' for method = \"accurate\". tz_loc <- tz_lookup_coords(stations$lat, stations$long, method = \"accurate\") Print the timezone location. PRF is equivalent to \"America/Toronto\". > tz_loc [1] \"America/Toronto\" The UTC offset can then be determined from the timezone location. utc <- tz_offset(\"2007-05-10\", tz_loc)[[5]] Print the UTC offset. > utc [1] -4 Since May 10, 2007 is during daylight savings the UTC offset calculated above corresponds to Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), UTC-4. This matches the timezone column provided since this data was collected using EDT. For Eastern Standard Time (EST), the UTC offset would be UTC-5.","title":"Hourly FWI R"},{"location":"tutorials/Hourly_FWI_R/#hourly-fwi-tutorial-r","text":"Last updated: November 5th, 2025","title":"Hourly FWI Tutorial - R"},{"location":"tutorials/Hourly_FWI_R/#what-youll-need","text":"The following files can be found on the cffdrs-ng GitHub repository : data/ PRF2007_hourly_wx.csv FWI/ R/ tutorial/ tutorial_hourly_FWI.r NG_FWI.r util.r daily_summaries.r If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, there are many options for you to retrieve the code and data files: Download each file to your computer individually.
