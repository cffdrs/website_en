All three languages contain the same equations and perform the same tasks, the choice is yours depending on your system requirement. The Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) is a major subsystem of the CFFDRS. FWI2025 is the next generation FWI system corresponding to the CFFDRS2025. The following describes the files, data inputs, parameters, and outputs in a general way for all three languages, noting the variations for specific languages. Fire Weather Index 2025 Scripts Each programming language has two scripts that are required to generate FWI2025 outputs: \"NG_FWI\" holds the functions and equations for generating FWI2025 outputs. R : NG_FWI.r Python : NG_FWI.py C : NG_FWI.c \"util\" includes basic functions that are not part of FWI2025 equations, but generate intermediate information for the calculation of the FWI2025 components (e.g. time of sunrise and sunset, number of sunlight hours). This script also includes the process to generate the daily summary output. R : util.r Python : util.py C : util.c , util.h Packages The FWI2025 scripts require different sets of language-specific libraries or packages. These must be installed prior to running \"NG_FWI\". R : lubridate and data.table Python : datetime, logging, math, numpy, pandas, os.path, sys C : stdlib.h, stdbool.h, string.h Get Started The cffdrs-ng GitHub repository also includes a tutorial script and test data. See the Tutorials#Hourly FWI for a step-by-step workflow with hourly data. The documentation below goes into details about specific functions and data requirements. Format FWI2025 code is written for and tested using input data in the form of a table/array, commonly imported as comma-separated value (.csv) files. Outputs are then also of the same form. Users can configure the input and output file types to fit their individual data streams. Documentation Hourly Fire Weather Index The hFWI() function in the \"NG_FWI\" file is built to generate FWI System outputs one station at a time. The R and Python versions can also output multiple stations with a properly formatted input. The C version can only handle inputs of a single year for a given station. Input Data The Fire Weather Index System was originally designed to be calculated using data recorded at local weather stations . As a result, descriptions below reference weather station data as input. In reality, any collected or calculated weather data (e.g. gridded data, forecast data, etc.) that includes the standard variables required as input to the FWI System can be used. See the Weather Guide for a description of weather data input standards for the FWI System. The rows of the dataframe should correspond to consecutive hourly data. The columns and data types of the input dataframe are as follows: Column Description id Weather station identifier, a unique number for the station, text or number lat Latitude of weather station, decimal degrees (\u00b0) (double precision) long Longitude of weather station, decimal degrees (\u00b0) (double precision) yr Year of weather station reading, number YYYY mon Month of weather station reading, number M or MM (must be consistent throughout the dataset) day Day of weather station reading, number DD or D (must be consistent throughout the dataset) hr Hour of weather station reading, number in military time (0-23) temp Temperature in degrees Celsius (\u00b0C), number rh Relative humidity in percent (%), number (0-100) ws Wind speed in kilometres per hour (km/hr), number prec Precipitation (rain) measured in millimetres (mm), number solrad Solar Radiation measured in kilowatts per square metre (kW/m^2) for grassland codes, number. OPTIONAL input, FWI2025 will generate based on default method. ( CFFDRS2025 Solar Radiation Input (Draft) \ud83d\udce5) percent_cured Percent Cured of grasses in open grassland, measured in percent for grassland codes, number (0-100). OPTIONAL input, FWI2025 will generate based on default method The column headers can be lower case or upper case, the output format is set to upper case. In addition to the weather variables, the function to generate hourly FWI2025 outputs requires the timezone where the weather station is located and the start-up value for the moisture codes (e.g. FFMC of 85, DMC of 6 and DC of 15). See the next section below to see where it is specified. Function Parameters R : hFWI(df_wx, timezone, ffmc_old = 85, dmc_old = 6, dc_old = 15) Parameter Description df_wx Data frame or formatted table (can have multiple years and stations, needs to be temporally sequential during a given year) timezone Timezone in which the weather station is located as the number of offset hours from UTC (e.g. for stations in Central Standard time the timezone is set to -6) ffmc_old dmc_old The start-up value of the duff moisture code (e.g. 6, this is the default) dc_old The start-up value of the drought code (e.g. 15, this is the default) Python : hFWI(df_wx, ffmc_old = 85, dmc_old = 6, dc_old = 15, silent = False) Parameter Description df_wx Data frame or formatted table (can have multiple years and stations, needs to be temporally sequential during a given year) timezone Timezone in which the weather station is located ffmc_old The startup value of the fine fuel moisture code (e.g. 85, this is the default) dmc_old The start-up value of the duff moisture code (e.g. 6, this is the default) dc_old The start-up value of the drought code (e.g. 15, this is the default) silent Print progress messages to monitor script. True or False, False by default C : The C version can be run from command line with the following arguments in order: Code Description local GMToffset Timezone in which the weather station is located starting FFMC The startup value of the fine fuel moisture code (e.g. 85) starting DMC The start-up value of the duff moisture code (e.g. 6) starting DC The start-up value of the drought code (e.g. 15) input file Name of .csv file containing data for a single station over the course of a year output file Name of the file to output results into Output Description The output is also the same format as the input data, with the following columns appended: Column Description timestamp Date and time of weather and FWI variable.

These can be found within the \u2018util\u2019 file. generate_daily_summaries() boils down the hourly data into some daily metrics. Input Data The only input to generate_daily_summaries() is the output from hFWI() .

Can also be called duration of a burning window, number of hours in the day where one could expect an active fire (where a modified ISI is equal or greater than five). If the ISI did not reach 5 or greater, the duration is zero wind_speed_smoothed Wind Speed in kilometres per hour (km/hr), double precision. Hourly wind speed recorded based on a 10 min average can be noisy hour-to-hour, this makes it difficult to estimate the duration of a burning window. To estimate the duration of a burning window and peak time, the hourly windspeed is smoothed and the ISI is recalculated based on the smoothed wind speed and FFMC peak_isi_smoothed Maximum Initial Spread Index (ISI) recalculated based on FFMC and smoothed wind speed from \u2018wind_speed_smoothed\u2019, double precision number.

The data provided in wx_prf.csv is already formatted with the required column names and is in a sequential hourly format. *only R version is currently available What you'll need Go to the CFFDRS-NG repo and fork/clone/download the following in the language of your choice: NG_FWI.r util.r wx_prf.csv Tutorial_NGFWI.r \ud83d\udce5 Prior to running this tutorial, the user should ensure they have the necessary packages and libraries installed. Each programming language references different packages or libraries, see Code#Packages for more details, or look in the code files. Data wx_prf.csv contains hourly weather recorded from the Petawawa Research Forest weather station during the 2007 field season. The data is sorted by ascending order and has no gaps. The column headers are those required for hourly FWI calculations, details can be found at Code#Hourly Fire Weather Index . There is no input for solar radiation ( sol_rad ) or curing fraction ( percent_cure ) because these are optional inputs and they will be automatically estimated if they are not given. Steps Open the Tutorial_NGFWI.r code file. You can either follow the code and comments in the file or continue on this page (both include the same code and content). Load libraries Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. Run install.packages() to install any you are missing. library(lubridate) library(data.table) library(lutz) Check your current working directory getwd() If the working directory is different from where you saved NG_FWI.r , util.r , and wx_prf.csv , change the working directory with setwd() to the folder containing these files.

The UTC timezone offset is a required input for the FWI2025 function. The 'lutz' library has functions to get the timezone of the weather station, based on Latitude and Longitude. First, make a dataframe with all the unique stations including ID, Latitude and Longitude. stations <- cbind(data$id, data$lat, data$long) colnames(stations) <- c(\"id\", \"lat\", \"long\") stations <- as.data.frame(stations) stations <- unique(stations) stations$lat <- as.numeric(stations$lat) stations$long <- as.numeric(stations$long) If you print the unique stations, you should see only one for Petawawa Research Forest: > stations id lat long 1 PRF 46.01393 -77.41804 Next, find the location for each unique ID based on Latitude and Longitude. tz_lookup_coords() can take some time. You may need to download the package 'sf' for method = \"accurate\". tz_loc <- tz_lookup_coords(stations$lat, stations$long, method = \"accurate\") Petawawa Research Forest is in the same timezone as Toronto: > tz_loc [1] \"America/Toronto\" Find the UTC offset, using the first day in the PRF dataset. utc <- tz_offset(\"2007-05-10\", tz_loc)[[5]] Printing the UTC offset for this tutorial, PRF from May-August 2007 is all in Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), which is UTC -4: > utc [1] -4 Calculate hourly FWI System outputs with FWI2025 hFWI() is the function that calculates hourly FWI codes in FWI2025.
